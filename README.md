This project implements a Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction system for online advertising. The auction system consists of Users, Bidders, and an Auction manager that executes multiple rounds of bidding.

The goal is to design a smart bidding agent that strategically balances exploration and exploitation to maximize profits while competing against other bidders.
